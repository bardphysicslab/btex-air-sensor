# Firmware

Firmware development for BardBox projects uses VS Code with PlatformIO.

The Arduino framework is acceptable, but it should be used through PlatformIO
rather than the Arduino IDE. Keep deployment firmware in this structure:

```text
firmware/
  platformio.ini
  src/main.cpp
  include/
  lib/
```

The example node implements the compact BardBox device protocol:

- `INFO`
- `HEADER`
- `READ`
- optional `PING`

The example UID is `bb-prj-air-001`. New UIDs must follow
`bb-<site>-<type>-<instance>` with 3-letter lowercase site/type codes and a
3-digit instance. Legacy `bb-0001` style IDs are deprecated for new projects.

Firmware only reports readings. It does not decide whether a node is stale or
unavailable; the Raspberry Pi/backend tracks communication freshness and
normalizes stale or unavailable API values to `null`.
